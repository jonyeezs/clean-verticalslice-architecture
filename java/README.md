# Java specific information

# Code structure
We use spring boot but we diverge from their folder/namespace structure. We move to a [package by use case structure](https://medium.com/sahibinden-technology/package-by-layer-vs-package-by-feature-7e89cde2ae3a)

We still initialize it using https://start.spring.io/
